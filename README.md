## Description

This script allows you to easily insert a visual novel note into your Obsidian vault using the [Quickadd plugin](https://github.com/chhoumann/quickadd) by @chhoumann. **Now also works on Mobile (make sure you use latest QuickAdd) !**

Uses the [vndb API](https://api.vndb.org/kana) to get the game information.

## Disclaimer

**Please never run a script that you don't understand. I cannot and will not be liable for any damage caused by the use of this script. Regularly make a backup of your Obsidian's vault !**

## Installation

1. Make sure you use latest QuickAdd version (at least 0.5.1) !
2. Save the script from the [latest release](https://github.com/akatopo/script-vndb-quickadd/releases/) to your vault somewhere. Make sure it is saved as a JavaScript file, meaning that it has the `.js` at the end.
3. Create a new template in your designated templates folder. Example template is provided below.
4. Open the Macro Manager by opening the QuickAdd plugin settings and clicking `Manage Macros`.
5. Create a new Macro - you decide what to name it.
6. Add the user script to the command list.
7. Add a new Template step to the macro. This will be what creates the note in your vault. Settings are as follows:
   1. Set the template path to the template you created.
   2. Enable File Name Format and use `{{VALUE:fileName}}` as the file name format. You can specify this however you like. The `fileName` value is the name of game without illegal file name characters.
   3. The remaining settings are for you to specify depending on your needs.
8. Click on the cog icon to the right of the script step to configure the script settings. This should allow you to set the path where game posters will be downloaded (the default is the vault root) and toggle clipboard data being used for game search.
9.  Go back out to your QuickAdd main menu and add a new Macro choice. Again, you decide the name. This is what activates the macro.
10. Attach the Macro to the Macro Choice you just created. Do so by clicking the cog âš™ icon and selecting it.
